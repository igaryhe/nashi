Dan is a self-taught game designer and programmer, currently studying at [NYU Game Center](https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/).

Video games are an important part of Dan's life. He started playing video games ever since three years old. The turning point of Dan's life was when he played [Braid](http://braid-game.com/) and [Fez](http://www.fezgame.com/). These two games made him realize the importance of game design, and even small teams could make video games as great as triple A titles. From then on, he started learning game design on his own.

Inspired by [Jonathan Blow](https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow), [Stephen Lavelle](https://increpare.com/), Philippe Poisson and [Alan Hazelden](https://www.draknek.org/), Dan is especially keen on puzzle games. He believes the artistic part of the video games lies in the ingeniously designed puzzles. Thus, a majority of his current works are puzzle games.
